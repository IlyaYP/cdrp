|Field Name|Range of Values|Description|
|---|---|---|
|cdrRecordType|0, 1, 2|Defines the type of record. The following valid values apply:<br><br>- 0—Start call detail record (not used)<br>    <br>- 1—End call detail record (CDR)<br>    <br>- 2—CMR record<br>    <br><br>Default - For CDRs, this field always remains 1.|
|globalCallID_callManagerId|Positive Integer|Designates a unique Unified Communications Manager identity.<br><br>The Global Call ID comprises two fields: globalCallID_callId globalCallID_callManagerId.<br><br>All records that are associated with a standard call have the same Global Call ID in them.<br><br>Default - Ensure that this field is populated.|
|globalCallID_callId|Positive Integer|Designates a unique call identity value that is assigned to each call. The system allocates this identifier independently on each call server. Values get chosen sequentially when a call begins. A value gets assigned for each call, successful or unsuccessful. When Unified Communications Manager restarts, it checks the file for the current globalCallID_callId number and assigns the next 1000th number to the next GlobalCallID_callId.<br><br>The Global Call ID consists of two fields: globalCallID_callId globalCallID_callManagerId.<br><br>All records that are associated with a standard call have the same Global Call ID in them.<br><br>      <br><br>**Note**For Unified Communications Manager Release 5.x and later releases, the value in the GlobalCallId CDR field survives over Unified Communications Manager restarts. In Release 4.x and earlier releases, although the GlobalCallId field is time-based, the field gets reused under conditions of heavy traffic. Because of this behavior, problems can occur with customer billing applications and the ability of CAR to correlate CMRs with CDRs and to correlate conference call CDRs. For Release 5.x and later releases, GlobalCallId redesign ensures that the field retains a unique value, at least for a certain number of days. Now, the last used globalCallId_callId value gets written to disk periodically (for every x number of calls). The value gets retrieved after a Unified Communications Manager restart, and the new globalCallId_callId value begins with this number plus x.<br><br>Default - Ensure that this field is populated.|
